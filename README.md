#Real-Time Data Reading: The read_data function reads RPM, temperature, and throttle position from the ECU.
Parameter Adjustment: The optimize_engine_params function adjusts throttle, fuel injection, and ignition timing based on the read data.
Sending Commands: The write_data function sends the adjusted parameters back to the ECU for real-time control.
